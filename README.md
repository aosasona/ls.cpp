# CPP `ls`

Another attempt to learn C++ by implementing a basic version of `ls` command

## Usage

```bash
mkdir build; cd build
cmake ..
make
./ls [options] [path]
```

## Arguments

- `-a` - show hidden files
- `-l` - show detailed information about files
- `-la` - show hidden files and detailed information about files

## Other versions

I have also attempted to implement this in other languages:
- [Rust](https://github.com/aosasona/ls.rs)
- [Go](https://github.com/aosasona/go.rs)

## Todo
- [ ] Implement `-a` option
- [ ] Implement `-l` option
